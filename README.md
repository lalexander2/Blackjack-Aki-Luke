# Blackjack-Aki-Luke


Estimated - 400 lines of Code


While working on this project we overcame obstacles on multiple aspects of programming. The project began with research on proper javadoc commenting. We underwent this research to ensure that our program was easily readible and accesible to potential viewers and possible contributors. After we both had a thorough underdstanding of how to properly implement javadoc comments.   

We both researched how we can best form the model, view and controller of the program. When researching the view we deterimed that most of the work in this folder would be done in the android studio enviornment in the form of xml files. When researching the model we determined this would be a folder of multiple java classes to build the foundation of the game(Card.java Deck.java). Last we deterimed the controller as the classes we will need to build the game(MainActivity.java) and the class we will need to use to combine the activity of the game with the view.
 
After doing the intensive research, we divided the work into what work needing to be done on each of the three. Luke took the lead in the files needed to be added for view and the controller. Aki took the lead in the files needed to be added for the model class. 11 Hours were logged on the project for Luke. 9 hours were logged on the project for Aki. Luke completed 350 lines of code and Aki completed 200 lines of code.


Note: Blackjacks and busts do not work, but a bust will still result in a loss. Additionally, aces are always counted as 11.
